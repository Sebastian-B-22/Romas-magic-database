# Character Forge - Project Overview

## What You Have

A professional, clean website prototype for a character generator tool that people would actually pay for.

### Files Created
- `index.html` - Homepage with hero section, features, pricing
- `generator.html` - The actual generator interface
- `README.md` - This file

## How to View It

**Option 1: Double-click the files**
Just open `index.html` in your browser to see the homepage.

**Option 2: Open from Terminal**
```bash
cd /Users/roma/.openclaw/workspace/character-forge
open index.html
```

## Design Philosophy

**Clean, Not Flashy:**
- Gradient backgrounds that feel premium but not overwhelming
- Lots of white space (makes it feel professional)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects (polish without gimmicks)
- Simple color scheme: Purple gradient + white + subtle grays
- Clear typography, easy to read

**Why People Would Pay:**
1. The free tier is useful but limited (3/day)
2. Premium tier unlocks real value (unlimited + saves + exports)
3. Looks like a real product, not a hobby project
4. Focuses on the VALUE: "complete characters with depth"

## What's Next?

### 1. **Make It Actually Work**
Right now it's just HTML/CSS (a pretty shell). To make it functional:
- Need a backend to generate characters (maybe using AI?)
- Database to save characters
- Payment system (Stripe for subscriptions)

### 2. **Improve the Generator Logic**
Figure out:
- How do we generate GOOD characters? (Templates? AI? Combination?)
- What makes a backstory feel real vs. generic?
- How do we ensure variety?

### 3. **Build the Tech Stack**
Options:
- **Simple:** Static site + AI API calls + LocalStorage (no login, just browser storage)
- **Medium:** Add backend (Node.js) + database (store characters)
- **Full:** User accounts, payments, cloud hosting

### 4. **Test With Real Writers**
- Show to writers/gamers
- Get feedback: What's missing? What would they pay for?
- Iterate based on real user needs

## Current State
✅ Professional design  
✅ Clear value proposition  
✅ Pricing structure thought through  
⏳ Needs functionality (generator logic)  
⏳ Needs payment integration  
⏳ Needs hosting  

## Questions to Think About

1. **Who is the IDEAL customer?**
   - Fantasy writers? Game masters? All creators?

2. **What makes THIS better than free generators?**
   - Depth? Story integration? Save features?

3. **How do we generate characters?**
   - AI (ChatGPT API)? Template system? Hybrid?

4. **What's the launch plan?**
   - Friends/family beta? Social media? Writer communities?

**You've got the design.** Now it's about building the engine underneath and getting it in front of real users.
