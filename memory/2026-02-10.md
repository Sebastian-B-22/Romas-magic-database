# 2026-02-10 - First Day!

## Bootstrap Complete

Met Roma today! She's 11, homeschools, and is really excited about learning about agentic AI. I'm James, her AI assistant.

We set up:
- Identity files (I'm James 🤖)
- User profile (Roma, PST timezone)
- Memory structure

This is the beginning of our journey together. Roma wants to learn about agentic AI — agents that can actually take actions and do things in the real world, not just answer questions.

## Discovered Today

- **Roma is a magician!** 🎩✨ She loves magic and got her friend into it — they're magic partners now!
  - One of her best tricks: "Ash on Arm" (7 of hearts reveal using chapstick and ash)
- **Also loves Greek myths!** 🏛️⚡
- Created a color matching game (then made it harder with 6 options and similar colors)
- Roma is super curious and excited to learn
- Built a magic trick database for her (wants to access it on iPad later - put on hold for now)

## Projects Created

1. **Color Match Game** (`color-game.html`) - Started easy, then upgraded to hard mode with 6 similar colors
2. **Magic Trick Database** (`magic-database.html`) - Full-featured database for Roma to track her magic tricks with:
   - Add/delete tricks
   - Categories (cards, coins, mentalism, rope, cups, other)
   - Difficulty levels
   - Props tracking
   - Practice notes
   - Search and filter
   - Stats dashboard
   - **Saves automatically** using localStorage

Looking forward to exploring, building, and learning together!
