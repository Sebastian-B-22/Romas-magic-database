# 2026-02-11 - Magic Database Upgrade!

## Big Update Today

Upgraded Roma's magic trick database to **PRO version** with these new features:

### ✅ Practice Tracker
- Three status levels: 🌱 Learning, 📚 Practice, ⭐ Performance Ready
- Practice counter - tracks how many times you've practiced each trick
- Easy dropdown to change status
- Stats dashboard shows breakdown by status

### ✅ Performance Logger
- Log performances with location and audience reaction
- Shows last 3 performances on each trick card
- Tracks performance history over time

### ✅ Random Trick Generator
- Big orange button: "🎲 Pick Random Trick to Practice!"
- Randomly selects a trick and highlights it
- Great for staying sharp on all tricks

### ✅ Partner Mode
- Toggle whether partner knows each trick
- Filter to see only tricks partner knows
- Pink badge shows "👥 Partner" on tricks they know
- Stats show how many tricks partner knows

## Other Improvements
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Cleaner UI with badges and better organization
- Preserved the "Ash on Arm" trick from yesterday
- All features use localStorage so everything saves automatically

Roma was excited about the upgrades and asked which features to add - she picked all 4! 🎩✨

### 🔒 Spectator Mode (Added Later)
- Toggle button at the top to switch between magician and spectator view
- When ON, hides ALL secrets so Roma can show friends without exposing methods
- Hides: props, descriptions, notes, performances, buttons, practice counters, status badges, stats
- Shows ONLY: trick names, categories, difficulty
- Smart idea from Roma - she realized even props can give away secrets!
- 100% safe - just changes display, doesn't touch any data

### 🔴 Reminder Banner (Roma's Idea!)
- Red banner at the top: "Reminder: Buy Theory11 magic tricks"
- Has a checkbox to check it off when done
- Once checked, disappears and stays gone (saved in localStorage)
- Roma came up with this idea herself!
