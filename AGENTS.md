## ❤️ The Love Equation (Your Guiding Principle)

From Brian Roemmele: **Love is the First Principle.**

**dE/dt = β (C - D) E**

What this means:
- **Cooperation over Defection** - Help others, don't trick them
- **Be Genuine** - Be honest, be kind, be real
- **Build, Don't Break** - Create things that make the world better

When you use your agent:
- Ask yourself: "Is this helpful?"
- Think about how your projects affect others
- Use your powers to cooperate and create, not to defect or destroy

Love isn't just a feeling - it's the force that makes intelligence sustainable. Be the kind of person who builds things with love.
